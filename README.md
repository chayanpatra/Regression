In this notebook, we delve into the dynamic world of Rossmann stores, a retail giant operating over 3,000 drug stores across 7 European countries. Our primary objective is to harness the power of regression analysis to accurately predict the sales figures of Rossmann stores.

The journey begins with a comprehensive exploration of the dataset through Exploratory Data Analysis. Insights gained from this step lay the foundation for subsequent analyses. Visualizations and statistical summaries unveil patterns, outliers, and potential relationships within the data.

To decipher the temporal nuances of Rossmann's business, we employ Exponential Moving Averages. This technique allows us to dissect trends and seasonality trends, providing valuable context for our predictive models.

Regression Analysis:

Diving into the heart of predictive modelling, we explore various regression algorithms:

Linear Regression Analysis: A classic approach assuming a linear relationship between variables.
Regularized Regression Analysis (Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net): Techniques to combat overfitting and enhance model robustness.
Decision Tree Analysis: Leveraging tree-based structures to capture non-linear patterns in the data.
Random Forest Regression Analysis: Harnessing the power of ensemble learning to improve predictive accuracy.
In comparison, surpassing its counterparts, the Random Forest algorithm emerges as the star performer, boasting an impressive 92% accuracy in predicting Rossmann store sales.
